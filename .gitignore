# You had 'server/public' here.
# --- READ THIS CAREFULLY ---
# Most times, 'server/public' contains images, CSS, or other public files
# that your website needs to work. If your website needs these files
# to be online, then you DO NOT want to ignore them.
# So, I'm REMOVING it from the default ignore list.
# If, however, 'server/public' *only* contains temporary generated files
# that are NOT needed for your app to run, then you can add it back here:
# server/public
