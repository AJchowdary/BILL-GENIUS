Key UI/UX Principles for Expense Tracking Apps (2025 Trends)
Minimalist, Clean Design:

Use generous white space and clear typography.

Use rounded corners for buttons, cards, and input fields to make the app feel friendly and approachable.

Card-Based Layouts:

Display expenses as cards for easy scanning and interaction.

Intuitive Navigation:

Stick to familiar navigation patterns (bottom or top tabs).

Consistent Color Scheme:

Use a light, neutral background with accent colors for important actions (like “Add Expense”).

Clear Visual Hierarchy:

Make the most important actions (add expense, view summary) stand out.

Mobile-First:

Design for mobile screens first, ensuring everything is easy to tap and read.
